This is a portfolio website that I built using HTML, TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Git.

I built this website to showcase my projects and skills. I used Next.js to build the website, and I used TypeScript to write the code. I also used Git to manage the codebase and version control.

I learned a lot from building this website, and I'm proud of the final result. I'm excited to share it with the world and use it to showcase my work.
